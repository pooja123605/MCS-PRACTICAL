Model the following University information system as a graph model, and answer the following queries using Cypher.
University has various departments like Mathematics, Geology, Chemistry, etc. Each department conducts various courses and a course may be conducted by multiple departments. Every course may have recommendations provided by people.
1.	Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, and draw Graph model.
2.	Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and visualize your actual Graph model.
3.	Answer the Queries
	a.	List the names of the courses provided by Chemistry Department. 
	b.	List the details of all the departments in the university.
	c.	List the names of common courses across chemistry and zoology department. 
	d.	List the most recommended course in Computer Science Department.
