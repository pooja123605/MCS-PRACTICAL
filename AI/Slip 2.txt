Write a Program to check whether the given no is prime or not.          

SOLUTION 

num=int(input("Enter your number"))
if num > 1: 
    for i in range(2, int(num/2)+1): 
         if (num % i) == 0: 
              print(num, "is not a prime number") 
              break 
    else: 
          print(num, "is a prime number") 
          # print(num, "is not a prime number")


2)Program to perform different set operations like Difference of E and N Symmetric difference of E and N  where                 
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}; and N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

SOLUTION 

# set difference
print("Difference of E and N is",E - N)

# set symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is",E ^ N)

Output
Difference of E and N is {8, 0, 6}
Symmetric difference of E and N is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
