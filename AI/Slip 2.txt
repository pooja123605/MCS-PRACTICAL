Write a Program to check whether the given no is prime or not.          

SOLUTION 

# Python program to check if the input number is prime or not
num = 407

# take input from the user
# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
 # check for factors
for i in range(2,num):
if (num % i) == 0:
print(num,"is not a prime number")
print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)
break
else:
print(num,"is a prime number")
# if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
print(num,"is not a prime number")

Output
407 is not a prime number
11 times 37 is 407

Program to perform different set operations like Difference of E and N Symmetric difference of E and N  where                 
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}; and N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

SOLUTION 

# set difference
print("Difference of E and N is",E - N)

# set symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is",E ^ N)

Output
Difference of E and N is {8, 0, 6}
Symmetric difference of E and N is {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
