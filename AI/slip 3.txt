Write a Program to find factorial of the given no.                

SOLUTION 

# Python program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user.
# change the value for a different result
num = 7
# uncomment to take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
for i in range(1,num + 1):
factorial = factorial*i
print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)

Output
The factorial of 7 is 5040

Program to perform different set operations like Union of E and N Intersection of E and N where                                                     [20 M]
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

SOLUTION 

# set union
print("Union of E and N is",E | N)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is",E & N)

Output
Union of E and N is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Intersection of E and N is {2, 4}
