Write a Program to find factorial of the given no.                

SOLUTION 

def factorial(n):
 

    

    return 1 if (n==1 or n==0) else n * factorial(n - 1) 
 
 


num = 5

print ("Factorial of",num,"is",

      factorial(num))

2)Program to perform different set operations like Union of E and N Intersection of E and N where                                                     [20 M]
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

SOLUTION 

# set union
print("Union of E and N is",E | N)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is",E & N)

Output
Union of E and N is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Intersection of E and N is {2, 4}
